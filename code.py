# Load Datasets
# The “Xs” has 10 entries, each has the feature matrix of a dataset, and the “ys” has 10 entries, each has the target array.
# The datasets are downloaded from scikit-learn or UCI machine learning repository.
# We downloaded the datasets and "pickle"d them for you; you should be able to un"pickle" them
# using the following code, but if pickle fails, please use the attached load_datasets code.

print("Loading datasets...")
Xs = pickle.load(open('datasets_x.pkl', 'rb'))
ys = pickle.load(open('datasets_y.pkl', 'rb'))
print("Done.")

# Accuracies on the train set. Rows are datasets, columns are decision trees with depths ranging from 1 to 15.
# Note that the arrays start with a zero index; not 1. So, the ith column should have the result of the tree that has depth (i+1).
train_ac = np.zeros((10, 15))

# Accuracies on the test set.
test_ac = np.zeros((10, 15))



############ TODO ############
# Your task is to do the following, per dataset; tip: you might find it easier loop over datasets
# 1. 	Create a train_test split of your dataset Xi, yi. Use train_test_split() method from scikit-learn.
#		Test size should be set to 1./3, and random_state should set to the 4th, 5th, and 6th digits of your A# (AXXX123XX).
# 2. 	For a depth d, ranging from 1 to 15, inclusive,
# 2.a		Create a decision tree of maximum depth d, and random_state set to the last 3 digits of your A# (AXXXXX123).  
# 2.b 		Fit the classifier to your train split.
# 2.c		Compute the score (accuracy) of the classifier on your train split; record the result in the correct position in the train_ac array
# 2.d		Compute the score (accuracy) of the classifier on your test split; record the result in the correct position in the test_ac array
